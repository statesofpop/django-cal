django-cal
=================

Django app to enable exporting of events to iCalendar files. 
Imitates behavior of django.contrib.syndication and is based upon vobject
(http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/).

Heavy inspiration came from Christian Joergensen 
(http://www.technobabble.dk/2008/mar/06/exposing-calendar-events-using-icalendar-django/)
and Derek Willis (http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2007/07/31/django-ical-and-vobject/).
    
Documentation:
Please also see contrib.syndication documentation, django_cal imitates its
behavior: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/contrib/syndication/
Please also see vObject behavior regarding start and end of events. In short:
Use Date objects for all-day events, DateTime for more granular control. 
Define either duration or end time, never both.

    get_object(self, request, *args, **kwargs)    
                    Can be overriden to allow for more complex events,
                    see syndication documentation.
                    Optional, defaults to None.
       
The following parameters work analagous to how they're implemented in 
django.contrib.syndication. That means, the framework checks in the following
order: self.$param(obj), self.$param(), self.$param; obj being the object 
returned by self.get_object. 
    
    items           Returns the list of events.
                    Must be set.
    filename        Filename of the file returned in the view. 
                    Optional, defaults to 'events.ics'.
    cal_name        Name of the calendar. 
                    Optional, defaults to None.
    cal_desc        Description of the calendar. 
                    Optional, defaults to None.
    

    item_summary    The "title" of the item.
                    Optional, defaults to unicode representation of item.

    item_end        Duration or end time of item.
    item_duration   Optional, defaults to None. Must not define both.

    item_url        Optional, default calls item.get_absolute_url()

    item_uid        All correspond to their vEvent equivalents.
    item_start      All optional, all default to None.
    item_comment
    item_location
    item_last_modified
